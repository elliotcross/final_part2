<h1>Final Project Part 2 - Questions and Answers</h1><br>
<p class="question">What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</p>
<p class="answer">	I had a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS from an introductory class at Bellevue College. I had no knowledge of JavaScript at all.</p>
	
<p class="question">Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</p>
<p class="answer">	I built my portfolio from scratch.</p>
	
<p class="question">What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</p>
<p class="answer">	The most challenging part of the portfolio was working on the accessibility features such as adding closed captioning to the video. A second big challenge for me was the contact form, because I had trouble with that artifact in the course. It was good to master that for the final assignment.</p>

<p class="question">How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? </p>
<p class="answer">	This class was more advanced, so it made me see that there is a lot more to web development than I thought. JavaScript is much more challenging for me than HTML and CSS. So I realized that it will take a lot more work to master web development than I originally thought.</p>

<p class="question">What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</p>
<p class="answer">	I would recommend that they plan on spending more time than average on this course. Be sure to read all the materials and watch all the video lessons, more than once if necessary. If you stick with it, things will become clearer.</p>
